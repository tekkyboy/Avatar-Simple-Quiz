<div id="header"><h1>Which Element Bender would you be in the World of Avatar?</h1><img src="avatar.png" width="500" height="125" class="center"></div>
<form  id="form1">
<p><b>Question 1</b> - Which element do you think you can control?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="element" id="water1" value="1" />Air because who wouldn't want to fly through skies and run really fast?<br><br></label>
<label><input type="radio" name="element" id="earth1" value="2" />Water because it's likable and adaptable to life's challenges just like me.</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="element" id="fire1" value="3" />Earth because I support everyone in my life and I'm the strongest person I know.<br></label>
<label><input type="radio" name="element" id="air1" value="4" />Fire because it's flame-o-mazing my man. Let's turn up the heat!<br><br></label>
<label><input type="radio" name="element" id="none1" value="5" />Hmm... I'm not too sure. They're all pretty cool elements to control.<br><br></label>

<p><b>Question 2</b> - How would your friends describe you?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="friends" id="water2" value="1" />My friends tell me that I'm the older brother or sister they never had.<br><br></label>
<label><input type="radio" name="friends" id="earth2" value="2" />My friends think that I'm a really fun person to be around.<br><br><br></label>
<label><input type="radio" name="friends" id="fire2" value="3" />My friends say that I'm the most emotional and passionate person they know.</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="friends" id="air2" value="4" />I've never asked my friends what they think about me and I can't speak for what they think about me.</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="friends" id="none2" value="5" />I'm the most important guy that they know. They can't live without me in their life.</label>

<p><b>Question 3</b> - What can you say is your best trait?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="trait" id="water3" value="1" />I’m a very loyal person. I care for my friends and family much more than they realize.<br><br></label>
<label><input type="radio" name="trait" id="earth3" value="2" />I stand by my opinions and life choices. I get to decide who I am and what I want to do, nobody else.</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="trait" id="fire3" value="3" />I will do anything it takes to get what needs to be done, even when everyone else would give up.<br><br></label>
<label><input type="radio" name="trait" id="air3" value="4" />I am willing to sacrifice my personal needs in order to help everyone else out.<br><br></label>
<label><input type="radio" name="trait" id="none3" value="5" />Obviously… I have lots of great traits. What can I say? People like me for who I am.<br><br></label>

<p><b>Question 4</b> - What are your family values?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="family" id="water4" value="1" />Families are really important to me. I love my family with all my heart!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></label>
<label><input type="radio" name="family" id="earth4" value="2" />A family is one that accepts you unconditionally. They don’t control who you are or what you do. They show unconditional support and understanding.<br><br></label>
<label><input type="radio" name="family" id="fire4" value="3" />A family can be both good and evil to each person. It’s up to each family member to decide for themselves if they can be a healthy or a toxic presence to others in their lives.</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="family" id="air4" value="4" />I’m not that attached to my family but I know that my family supports me as long as I do my best in life.<br><br><br><br></label>
<label><input type="radio" name="family" id="none4" value="5" />I believe that families are important, but my personal experiences with my family doesn't define who I am.<br><br><br><br></label>

<p><b>Question 5</b> - What is something you have the most difficulty accepting?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="difficulty" id="water5" value="1" />I can’t always help the people I love the most.<br><br><br></label>
<label><input type="radio" name="difficulty" id="earth5" value="2" />Not many people like me. I try to say it doesn’t matter but I do want people to like me.</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="difficulty" id="fire5" value="3" />I’m not good enough and that I always need to do more to keep up with everyone else.</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="difficulty" id="air5" value="4" />That some people choose to be evil rather than to be good.<br><br></label>
<label><input type="radio" name="difficulty" id="none5" value="5" />I can’t understand people who don’t eat meat. It’s so good!!!<br><br><br></label>

<p><b>Question 6</b> - Do you think you could be the Avatar?</p>
<label><input type="radio" name="avatar" id="no" value="0" />Yes</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="avatar" id="yes" value="-22" />No</label>
